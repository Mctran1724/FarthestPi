"""
This implements a lattice point method for computing the mathematical constant pi.
This arises directly from the area of a circle.

Consider a circle with radius r centered at the origin.
The area of the circle is pi * r**2. 
Consider the lattice points within this circle.
As we increase the size of the circle, the error will decrease
